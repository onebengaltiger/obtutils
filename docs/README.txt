What is OBT SDK ?

A small set of utilities for programs. Includes stuff for databases, 
networking, messaging and debugging and many miscelaneous classes.

Check it out to see if you find something useful for your projects 
and let me know :D !!!

Requirements:

	.Net Framework 4.0 or superior
	.Net Framework SDK 4.0 or superior (to compile the source code)


Compiling:

To compile the SDK on windows systems, just open the solution file in the 
root directory with Visual Studio or Sharpdevelop. Using msbuild to 
compile the OBT SDK has not been tested, but it should work. 

Compiling with Mono or other versions of the .Net framework (e.g. in a linux 
system) has not been tested, so any help or comments with respect to this 
matter will be greatly appreciated.

For Windows systems, you can also download a .msi installer file from
the project's download page: https://code.google.com/p/obtutils/downloads/list


Instalation:

The installer package installs the libraries in the GAC. If you install from
the source, you can use the library without installing it to the GAC.


Documentation:

The documentation is work in progress, and it is available in the installer 
package and with the source code.


Comments, bugfixes ;) and suggestions are welcome at aragorn@ciencias.unam.mx


Thanks for using OBT SDK !!
Happy programming !!!
